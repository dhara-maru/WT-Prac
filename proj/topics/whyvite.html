<h2>Why Vite</h2> <hr>
<h4 class="p-3">Problems</h4>
<p class="p-3 m-3">Before ES modules were available in browsers, developers had no native mechanism for authoring JavaScript in a modularized fashion. This is why we are all familiar with the concept of "bundling": using tools that crawl, process and concatenate our source modules into files that can run in the browser.</p>

<p class="p-3 m-3">
    Over time we have seen tools like webpack, Rollup and Parcel, which greatly improved the development experience for frontend developers.
</p>
<p class="p-3 m-3">However, as we build more and more ambitious applications, the amount of JavaScript we are dealing with is also increasing dramatically. It is not uncommon for large scale projects to contain thousands of modules. We are starting to hit a performance bottleneck for JavaScript based tooling: it can often take an unreasonably long wait (sometimes up to minutes!) to spin up a dev server, and even with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), file edits can take a couple of seconds to be reflected in the browser. The slow feedback loop can greatly affect developers' productivity and happiness.</p>
<p class="p-3 m-3">Vite aims to address these issues by leveraging new advancements in the ecosystem: the availability of native ES modules in the browser, and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages.</p>
