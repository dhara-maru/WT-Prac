<p class="p-3 m-3">At the very basic level, developing using Vite is not that different from using a static file server. However, Vite provides many enhancements over native ESM imports to support various features that are typically seen in bundler-based setups.</p>

<h3>NPM Dependency Resolving and Pre-Bundling</h3> 
<p class="p-3 m-3">
    Native ES imports do not support bare module imports like the following:
</p>
<p class="p-3 m-3">import { someMethod } from 'my-dep'</p>
<p class="p-3 m-3">The above will throw an error in the browser. Vite will detect such bare module imports in all served source files and perform the following:</p>
<ol type="1" class="p-3 m-3">
    <li>
        Pre-bundle them to improve page loading speed and convert CommonJS / UMD modules to ESM. The pre-bundling step is performed with esbuild and makes Vite's cold start time significantly faster than any JavaScript-based bundler.
    </li><br>
    <li>
        Rewrite the imports to valid URLs like /node_modules/.vite/deps/my-dep.js?v=f3sf2ebd so that the browser can import them properly.
    </li>
</ol>
